But fear not, you need not be a tech pro to set this script up. No coding skills are required — I didn't even know how to code myself when I asked ChatGPT to write the code for me. That's right, I was too lazy to learn how to code, so I just asked a computer to do it for me. 

While the script itself is free, you will have to pay (small) fees to OpenAI for using GPT-3.
